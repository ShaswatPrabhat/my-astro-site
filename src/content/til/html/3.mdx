#### So, how do you actually build a lean, efficient site in 2023?
<br/>
* Start with mostly static HTML. If you’re building a blog or a marketing site or something like that, your journey can often stop here. Grab a tool like 11ty or Hugo and you’re good to go!
    
* Progressively enhance the dynamic parts. Have some API-driven content? Static-site generators can fetch that for you, too. But if it’s user-dependent or has to run in the browser, use JavaScript for just the parts that require it.
    
* Pick small, focused tools. Is your dynamic content rendered once and then done? Just use vanilla JavaScript. Does it get updated with user interactions? Grab a smaller state-based UI library like Preact or Solid instead of one of the big monolithic tools.
