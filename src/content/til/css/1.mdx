#### Units in Media queries

<br/>

* If your content is mostly image-based, pixels might make the most sense. If your content is mostly text-based, it probably makes more sense to use a relative unit that's based on text size, like `em` or `ch`.

* It's best to choose your breakpoints based on your content rather than popular device sizes, as those are subject to change with every technology release cycle.

* You can combine media queries so that the styles only apply when all the conditions are true.
```css
@media (min-width: 50em) and (min-height: 60em) {
  article {
    column-count: 2;
  }
}
```
