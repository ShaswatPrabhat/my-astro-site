* Any task that takes more than 50 milliseconds to run is considered a [long task](https://web.dev/long-tasks-devtools/#what-are-long-tasks).
* Device must create a new frame every 16 ms (~60fps)
* Additional time for other tasks while maintaining smooth visual experience.
* ##### Aim: Minimize long tasks (duh!)
* Total Blocking Time = TTI - FCP
* The Interaction to Next Paint (INP), a new Core Web Vitals metric, measures the time from a user's first interaction with the page (e.g. clicking a button) to when this interaction is visible on-screen; the next paint.
* INP is important for site like e-commerce with a lot of user interactions.
* A visual update in React is divided into two phases: the render phase and the commit phase.
* During the render phase, React calculates the differences between the current DOM and the new React component tree and prepares the necessary updates.
* In the commit phase, React applies the updates.
* A <u>synchronous</u> render is an “all-or-nothing” operation, where it’s guaranteed that a component that starts rendering will always finish.

* React 18 introduces a new concurrent renderer that operates behind the scenes. This renderer exposes some ways for us to mark certain renders as <u>non-urgent</u>

* React will yield back to the main thread every 5 milliseconds to see if there are more important tasks to handle.
* By continuously yielding back to the main thread, React is able to make such renders non-blocking and prioritize more important tasks.
* We can mark an update as non-urgent by using the `startTransition` function made available by the `useTransition` hook.
```jsx
import { useTransition } from "react";

function Button() {
  const [isPending, startTransition] = useTransition();

  return (
    <button
      onClick={() => {
        urgentUpdate();
        startTransition(() => {
          nonUrgentUpdate()
        })
      }}
    >...</button>
  )
}
```
* Transitions enable React to render multiple versions of the UI concurrently, and manage priorities between different tasks.
* It's up to the developer to optimize bundle size when working with Client Components and RSC. Developers can do this by:
    1. Ensuring that only the leaf-most node of the interactive component defines the "use client" directive. This may require some component decoupling.
    2. Passing component trees as props rather than importing them directly. This allows React to render the children as React Server Components without adding them to the client bundle.
* Using `Suspense` in combination with React Server Components allows us to directly access server-side data sources without requiring a separate API endpoint, such as databases or the file system.
* When a component is suspended, for example because it’s still waiting for data to load, React doesn't just sit idle until the component has received the data.
* Instead, it pauses the rendering of the suspended component and shifts its focus to other tasks.

* The combination of `Suspense` with React Server Component’s streamable format allows high-priority updates to be sent to the client as soon as they're ready, without waiting for lower-priority rendering tasks to complete.
