* Logs, metrics, traces, and exceptions can be clubbed into <u>Telemetry Signals</u>.
* Fully embrace OTEL in our codebase and use Jaeger as the preferred trace visualization tool.
* FE tracing needs to be included in the entry chunk of a page to monitor page load telemetry.
* Initial value addition with FE tracing - being able to see bottlenecks, inefficiencies, and so on.
* Present Value proposition - insights such as analyzing the costs of services and components, detecting incidents, responding to them, and assessing their impact.
