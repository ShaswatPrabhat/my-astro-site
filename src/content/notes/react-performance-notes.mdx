# Notes from Steve Kinney's React Performance Course
<br/>

## Notes
* Quick wins:
  * Are you running the app in production mode?
  * Use Keys for components mapped to arrays
  * These have no downside like Memoization which means atleast one Cache query
* Not doing stuff is faster than doing things - Component Hierarchy and state managment
* Sometimes skipping to do some work can be better - Memoization
* Put off doing stuff if possible - Suspense
* Do urgent stuff now and less urgent stuff later - Transition API
## React under the hood
* Something changed due to `useState` or `useReducer` effects
* Render Phase -> Commit Phase -> Clean up Phase
* Commit Phase takes the bunch of diffs and updates the VDOM updates the Refs to DOM nodes etc
* Clean up Phase triggers the clean up from useEffects etc
* CSS Animations won't happen on main thread
* Render Phase means a state change somewhere 
* The heurestic that React uses to re-render a Child Component is whether the Parent changed
* After that render phase we gather who is different now
* Number of State changes are batched
* Further we can push down the states the lesser number of rerenderings happen
*
