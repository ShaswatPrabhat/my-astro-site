* Your existing working JavaScript code is also TypeScript code.
* TypeScript knows the JavaScript language and will generate/infer types for you in many cases.
  ```ts
  let helloWorld = "Hello World";
  ```
* You can explicitly describe this object’s shape using an interface declaration:
  ```ts
    interface User {
        name: string;
        id: number;
    }
  ```
* You should prefer `interface`. Use `type` when you need specific features.
* Generics provide variables to type: 
  ```typescript
    type StringArray = Array<string>;
    type NumberArray = Array<number>;
    type ObjectWithNameArray = Array<{ name: string }>;
  ```

* One of TypeScript’s core principles is that type checking focuses on the shape that `value`s have. This is sometimes called `duck typing` or `structural typing`.
* There is no difference between how classes and objects conform to shapes:
  ```ts
    class VirtualPoint {
        x: number;
        y: number;

        constructor(x: number, y: number) {
            this.x = x;
            this.y = y;
        }
    }

    const newVPoint = new VirtualPoint(13, 56);
    logPoint(newVPoint); // logs "13, 56"
  ```
* TypeScript act a bit more strictly. In that case, you can use the `noEmitOnError` compiler option. 
* That’s why TypeScript needs a compiler in the first place - it needs some way to strip out or transform any TypeScript-specific code so that you can run it. 
* Using any often defeats the purpose of using TypeScript in the first place. The more typed your program is, the more validation and tooling you’ll get.
* Turning on the `noImplicitAny` flag will issue an error on any variables whose type is implicitly inferred as any.
* The type names `String`, `Number`, and `Boolean` (starting with capital letters) are legal, but refer to some special built-in types that will very rarely appear in your code. Always use `string`, `number`, or `boolean` for types.
* To specify the type of an array like `[1, 2, 3]`, you can use the syntax `number[]`.
* Note that `[number]` is a different thing; refer to the section on `Tuples`.
* When you don’t specify a type, and TypeScript can’t infer it from context, the compiler will typically default to `any`. Because `any` isn’t type-checked. Use the compiler flag `noImplicitAny` to flag any implicit `any` as an error.
* TypeScript doesn’t use <i>types on the left</i> style declarations like `int x = 0;` Type annotations will always go after the thing being typed.
* ```ts
    const names = ["Alice", "Bob", "Eve"];
    
    // Contextual typing for function - parameter s inferred to have type string
    names.forEach(function (s) {
      console.log(s.toUpperCase());
    });
    
    // Contextual typing also applies to arrow functions
    names.forEach((s) => {
      console.log(s.toUpperCase());
    });
  ```
  
  Even though the parameter `s` didn't have a type annotation, TypeScript used the types of the `forEach` function, along with the `inferred` type of the array, to determine the type `s` will have.

  This process is called `contextual typing` because the `context` that the function occurred within informs what type it should have.
