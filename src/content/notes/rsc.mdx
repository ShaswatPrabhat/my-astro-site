* From [Reactathon interview of Ben, Ryan and Tanner](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRVtu9_xi2k), ideally will run all the logic on the server and ideally eliminate the need to have hydration on Client side for server rendered apps.

* It eliminates the need to have the server side logic on your client side code.

* If something needs to be run on the client then used a directive to run all of it as a Client bundle.

* From [Jeff's talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TJOiXyVKExg), code complexity increases but so do the performance benefits with React.

* Some frameworks can reduce complexity.

* Parallel non blocking data loading by default
