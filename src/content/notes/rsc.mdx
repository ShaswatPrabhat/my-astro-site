#### Miscellaneous notes
* From [Reactathon interview of Ben, Ryan and Tanner](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRVtu9_xi2k), ideally will run all the logic on the server and ideally eliminate the need to have hydration on Client side for server rendered apps.
* It eliminates the need to have the server side logic on your client side code.
* If something needs to be run on the client then used a directive to run all of it as a Client bundle.
* From [Jeff's talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TJOiXyVKExg), code complexity increases but so do the performance benefits with React.
* Some frameworks can reduce complexity.
* Parallel non blocking data loading by default.

#### Notes from the RFC Read
* Server Components allow developers to build <u>apps that span the server and client.</u>
* Combines the rich interactivity of client-side apps with the improved performance of traditional server rendering.
* Server Components run <u>only on the server</u>. Hence they have zero constributions to bundle size.
* They can access Server side data resources like Databases, micro services directly.
* Server Components load data on the server and then pass it on to Client Components via props on the network.
* Server Components <u>preserve client state when reloaded.</u> This means that client state, focus, and even ongoing animations aren’t disrupted or reset when a Server Component tree is refetched.
* Server Components can incrementally stream rendered bits and pieces of the UI over network - <u>Incremental Hydration.</u>
* Combined with `Suspense` we are able to develop custom loading states on the Client side for Server Data.
* Developers can also <u>share code between the server and client.</u>
* We use `use client` directive to indicate a `client` side component.
    ```js
    // Note.js - Server Component
    import db from 'db'; 
    // (A1) We import from NoteEditor.js - a Client Component.
    import NoteEditor from 'NoteEditor';

    async function Note(props) {
    const {id, isEditing} = props;
    // (B) Can directly access server data sources during render, e.g. databases
    const note = await db.posts.get(id);
    
    return (
        <div>
        <h1>{note.title}</h1>
        <section>{note.body}</section>
        {/* (A2) Dynamically render the editor only if necessary */}
        {isEditing 
            ? <NoteEditor note={note} />
            : null
        }
        </div>
    );
    }
    ```
* Supports `top-level awaits` to ensure access to DB or micro services.
* Does not support concepts of `state` or `effects` as these are not relevant in a `Server space`.
* Can conditionally render `client components`, servers hand over the responsibility to `client`. These components are treated as normal React components and bundled accordingly.
* #### <u>Client Components are just regular components.</u>
* The fundamental challenge was that <u>React apps were client-centric and weren’t taking sufficient advantage of the server.</u>
* #### <u>First, we wanted to make it easier for developers to fall into the `pit of success` and achieve good performance by default.</u>
* #### <u>Second, we wanted to make it easier to fetch data in React apps.</u>
* Using libraries is helpful as developers but increases bundle size and can hurt application performance.
  ```js
  // NOTE: *before* Server Components
    import marked from 'marked'; // 35.9K (11.2K gzipped)
    import sanitizeHtml from 'sanitize-html'; // 206K (63.3K gzipped)

    function NoteWithMarkdown({text}) {
    const html = sanitizeHtml(marked(text));
    return (/* render */);
    }
  ```
* With Server components we can render this on the server and do not need to send this as a bundle to the client:
  ```js
  // Server Component === zero bundle size
    import marked from 'marked'; // zero bundle size
    import sanitizeHtml from 'sanitize-html'; // zero bundle size

    function NoteWithMarkdown({text}) {
    // same as before
    }
  ```
* A common theme is that developers have to expose additional endpoints to power their UI, or use existing endpoints that weren’t always designed with that UI in mind.
* Server Components treat all imports of Client Components as potential code-split points.
* The problem isn’t really the round trips, it’s that they are from client to server. By moving this logic to the server we reduce the request latency and improve performance.
* If a Server Component with multiple layers of wrappers for configurability ends up rendering to a single element, then that's all that will be sent to the client.
* PHP, Rails, etc — is certainly one way to address some of these challenges, but that approach makes it much harder to build rich, interactive experiences. This reflects a long-standing tension in the world of application development that predates the web: whether to use <u>thin</u> or <u>thick</u> clients.
* But mixing server and client rendering often means mixing technologies: writing code in two languages, using two frameworks, keeping two sets of idioms and ecosystems in mind.

#### The flow of Rendering:
1. Router will match the requested `URL` to a `Server Component`, passing the `route` parameters as `props` to the component.
2. React will render the `root` Server Component and any children that are also Server Components. Rendering stops at native components (`divs`, `spans` etc) and at Client Components. Native components are streamed as a `JSON` description of the UI, and Client Components are streamed including the serialized props.
3. You can think of the data streamed to the target as `JSON` but with `slots` for components that suspend, where the values to place into those `slots` are provided as additional items later in the response stream.
4. On the `client`, the framework receives the streamed React response and renders it on the page with React.
5. React deserializes the response and renders the native elements and Client Components. <u>This happens progressively — React doesn’t need to wait for the whole stream to finish in order to show something.</u>
6. React `reconciles` (merges) the new rendered output with the existing components on screen. Because the description of the UI is `data`, not `HTML`, React can merge new props into existing components, preserving important UI state such as focus or typing input, or triggering CSS transitions on existing content. This is a key reason that Server Components return rendered UI output as data (“virtual DOM”) instead of HTML.
7. Client Components can’t access server-only features like the filesystem, Server Components can’t access client-only features like state, and Client Components may only import other Client Components.
#### Server Components Rules:
* ❌ May not use state, because they execute (conceptually) only once per request, on the server. So useState() and useReducer() are not supported.
* ❌ May not use rendering lifecycle (effects). So useEffect() and useLayoutEffect() are not supported.
* ❌ May not use browser-only APIs such as the DOM (unless you polyfill them on the server).
* ❌ May not use custom hooks that depend on state or effects, or utility functions that depend on browser-only APIs.
* ✅ May use async / await with server-only data sources such as databases, internal (micro)services, filesystems, etc.
* ✅ May render other Server Components, native elements (div, span, etc), or Client Components.

#### Client Components Rules:
* ❌ May not import Server Components or call server hooks/utilities, because those only work on the server. However, a Server Component may pass another Server Component as a child to a Client Component: `<ClientTabBar><ServerTabContent /></ClientTabBar>`. From the Client Component’s perspective, its child will be an already rendered tree, such as the `ServerTabContent` output. This means that Server and Client components can be nested and interleaved in the tree at any level.
❌ May not use server-only data sources.
✅ May use state.
✅ May use effects.
✅ May use browser-only APIs.
✅ May use custom hooks and utilities that use state, effects or browser-only APIs.

* To mark a component as a Client Component, add ``use client'` directive at the top of your file.
* To be used only for Client Components that you import from Server Components.
