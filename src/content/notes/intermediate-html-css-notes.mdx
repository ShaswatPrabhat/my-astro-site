<br/>

## Notes
* [Course Website](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/intermediate-html-css/html-lists/)
* 4 kinds of `lists` in HTML
* Unordered lists - Bulletted lists
* Ordered lists - Numbered lists
* Description lists - Lists for Key Value pairs
* Menus or Interactive lists - Like a Button group powered by JS options
* Know the patterns in the HTML before writing the CSS based on those patterns in HTML
* If you cant see if you cant style it
* Put a border around any element that needs to be styled
* The below CSS is used for mostly to reset styling:
    ```css
    *,
    *::before,
    *::after {
    box-sizing: border-box;
    }
    ```
* Say I have a `font-family` property set on a `ul` element, Then all the childrent will<b> inherit</b> that property as well and the font will be applicable to all children of the `ul` element
* And this is where we can use `class` names for CSS selection, this too will be inherited by all children
* `id` s should appear only once in a page
* A Descendant Selector -  Grandchildren and below in an HTML tree are all descendants
* Read Selectors from <b> Right to left </b>
* flexbox and grid also have very specific properties for Children and parents, We can use Parent-child Selectors in this case
* `>` is th general parent-child selctor
* `~` is the genral sibling selector
* `+` is able to select only those that are next to each other
*
