* If you’re writing a `custom Hook`, <u>it’s recommended to wrap any functions that it returns into `useCallback`.</u> This ensures that the consumers of your Hook can optimize their own code when needed.

* The `context` from a `useContext` itself does not hold the information, it only represents the kind of information you can provide or read from components.
* React automatically re-renders components that read some context if it changes.
