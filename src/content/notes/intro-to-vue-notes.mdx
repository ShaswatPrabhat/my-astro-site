# Notes from Ben Holmes' course on Vue-fundamentals
* [Course site](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/vue-fundamentals/vue-overview/)
* Vue is Approachable - In React we write a lot more around what makes sense in Core JS, Contorting our site to what makes more sense in JS
* Performant - Vanilla JS and Browser APIs have come a long way and sometimes we might not even need a framework
* It is reactive, compiler-optimized, rarely needs manual optimizations
* Versatile - Scales between library to framework, one usually requires build tools, the other one does not
* Enterprise Proven - Apple uses Vue to build their introduction to SwiftUI, Google Careers page also uses Vue, Zoom as well, Loreal
* In Vue 2 we would be using `new Vue(` to instantiate the app while in vue 3 we normally use `createApp` from Vue.
* This is because `Vue3` is more modular and we hve split out the methods which are not needed
*
