[Vitest](https://vitest.dev/) is a new Javascript Unit testing framework which describes itself as _blazing fast_ and _Vite-native_.

In this post we will try and understand the basics of this framework while building an understanding of what makes Vitest different from existing libraries in this space.

<br />
<br />

#### A 100ft view of Vite

While we will not be covering [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) in this post, it will help us to understand some bits of it to appreciate Vitest better.

Vite is an [ESM-first](https://vitejs.dev/guide/why.html#the-problems) bundler which combines amazing developer experience with awesome speed.

Simply put, Vite brings in the best of both worlds - non-JS bundlers to provide amazing speed, and ESM-ness and all the advantages of native ESM via Rollup.
This means out of the box support for most of the features like code-splitting, CSS and Asset Handling, JSX, TS etc.
This also means a new way of thinking about your code in terms of ESM first and leaving the rest to Vite.

<br />
<br />

#### On to Vitest

Traditionally, [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) has been [the most widely](https://2022.stateofjs.com/en-US/libraries/testing/) used JS Unit testing framework of choice.
While Jest is an incredible framework, it has had some [slowness issues](https://blog.bitsrc.io/why-is-my-jest-suite-so-slow-2a4859bb9ac0).
But a bigger problem around Jest is the tooling that might be needed to run our first test. We might need a transpiler liked [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) and transformers to create Jest digestible code.

<br />
<br />

#### The bane of runtimes

Web development is closely tied to [runtimes](https://www.codecademy.com/article/introduction-to-javascript-runtime-environments). That means that even if our code is targeting Browsers of different generations (a challenge in its own), we might still need a lot of tooling for Node runtimes.
Our test runners and even build tools have had to deal with this disparity for a long time, hence the plethora of [plugins in tools like Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/plugins/) to target bundling of all kinds of file formats.

<br />
<br />

#### A possible solution?

What Vitest helps achieve is that the [same configuration](https://vitejs.dev/config/) for Vite dev and production can be used for testing, eliminating the middle layers of transpilers, coupled with all advantages of Vite's API ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥.

<br />
<br />

#### Ok, I am kind of convinced...

But there is more!

Below are some of the Vitest APIs and features that I have been loving.
For a full list [do check out the documentation](https://vitest.dev/api/):

<br />
<br />

=> [Configuring Vitest](https://vitest.dev/guide/#configuring-vitest) feels very similar to [configuring Vite](https://vitejs.dev/config/). A typical Vitest Config might look like below:

```ts
/// <reference types="vitest" />

import { defineConfig } from "vite";
import Vue from "@vitejs/plugin-vue";

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [Vue()],
  test: {
    globals: true,
    environment: "jsdom",
  },
});
```

<br />
<br />

=> [Rich CLI](https://vitest.dev/guide/cli.html) with most pragmatic options covered like [running related tests](https://vitest.dev/guide/cli.html#vitest-related), [watch mode](https://vitest.dev/guide/cli.html#vitest-watch), and [`changed` to run tests on changed files only](https://vitest.dev/guide/cli.html#changed). Scripts like below can be added to `package.json`:

```json
...
"scripts": {
    "test": "vitest",
    "test:watch": "vitest watch",
    "coverage": "vitest run --coverage"
  },
...
```

<br />
<br />

=> Inbuilt [coverage](https://vitest.dev/guide/coverage.html) support with `instanbul` and `c8`

<br />
<br />

=> The [amazing vi utility](https://vitest.dev/api/vi.html)provides powerful support for mocking, spying and timers. A sample mock in Vitest will look like:

```ts
vi.mock("../src/log.ts", async () => {
  const log = await import("../src/log");
  return {
    default: {
      ...log.default,
      info: vi.fn(),
    },
  };
});
```

and a spy like below:

```ts
const buySpy = vi.spyOn(market, "buy");
expect(buySpy).not.toHaveBeenCalled();
```

<br />
<br />

=> [Rust-inspired](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch11-03-test-organization.html#the-tests-module-and-cfgtest) in source-testing, a way to write and execute tests from [within the source code](https://vitest.dev/guide/in-source.html).

```ts
// src/index.ts
export function add(...args: number[]) {
  return args.reduce((a, b) => a + b, 0);
}
// in-source test suites
if (import.meta.vitest) {
  const { it, expect } = import.meta.vitest;
  it("add", () => {
    expect(add()).toBe(0);
    expect(add(1)).toBe(1);
    expect(add(1, 2, 3)).toBe(6);
  });
}
```

<br />
<br />

=> [Assertions](https://vitest.dev/api/expect.html) which are very similar to Jest or Mocha

<br />
<br />

=> [A shiny UI](https://vitest.dev/guide/ui.html) leveraging the underlying Vite dev server for running the tests.
