<h3>A bit about me</h3>
<br/>
I am Shaswat Prabhat.
<br/>
I have been in tech for more than 6 years now.
<br/>
I started my career at [Ericsson India](https://www.ericsson.com/en/about-us/company-facts/ericsson-worldwide/india) in 2015 after completing my B.Tech. in Computer Science from [KGEC](https://www.kgec.edu.in/).
<br/>
Then, I moved to [ThoughtWorks](https://www.thoughtworks.com/en-in) where I am till today.
<br/>

My career started with the Role of an Integration Engineer and then rapidly moved through Devops, Back-end and Front-end spheres.

I have kept dabbling in emerging tech, keen to learn, build and optimize.
