I am Shaswat Prabhat.

I have been in the tech industry for more than 6 years now.<br/>
I started my career at [Ericsson India](https://www.ericsson.com/en/about-us/company-facts/ericsson-worldwide/india) in 2015 after completing my B.Tech. in Computer Science from [KGEC](https://www.kgec.edu.in/).
I then moved to [ThoughtWorks](https://www.thoughtworks.com/en-in) where I am till today.

My career started with the Role of an Integration Engineer and then rapidly moved through Devops, Back-end and Front-end spheres.

I have kept dabbling in emerging tech, keen to learn, build and optimize.

Reach out to me on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/shaswat-prabhat-das/), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ShaswatPrabhat) or drop me a [mail](mailto:spd1238@gmail.com).

I love talking about tech, books, history, movies, music etc.
